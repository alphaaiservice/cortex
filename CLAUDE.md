# CLAUDE.md — Cortex Plugin Development Context

## What Is This Project?

This is a **Claude Code Plugin** called `cortex` (Cortex) built by Alpha AI Service Pvt Ltd. It automates the entire software development lifecycle — from project scaffolding to autonomous product building — with zero human intervention.

The plugin enforces Alpha AI's engineering standards across **3 backend languages**: Python/FastAPI, Node.js/NestJS, Java/Spring Boot — plus JWT+HTTP-Only Cookies (NEVER localStorage/sessionStorage), MySQL+ORM, MongoDB, Redis, and strict layer segregation.

---

## Plugin Architecture

This is NOT a regular Python/Node project. It is a **Claude Code Plugin** — a collection of Markdown instruction files, bash scripts, and JSON configs that extend Claude Code's capabilities.

## How Each Component Works

### Commands (`commands/*.md`)

These are Markdown files that become slash commands. When a user types `/auto-build`, Claude Code reads `commands/auto-build.md` and follows its instructions.

**File format:**
```markdown
---
description: "Shown in /help. Describes what the command does."
---

# Title

Instructions for Claude to follow when this command is invoked.
$ARGUMENTS = whatever the user types after the command name.
```

**Key rule:** The `description` field in frontmatter is what appears in `/help`. Keep it concise and clear.
**Key rule:** Do NOT use `allowed-tools` in command frontmatter — Claude Code doesn't recognize it for commands. All tools are available by default.

**Key rule:** `$ARGUMENTS` is a special variable that captures user input after the command name. E.g., `/auto-build ./PRD.md` → `$ARGUMENTS` = `./PRD.md`

### Agents (`agents/*.md`)

Subagents are specialized Claude instances with focused system prompts. They are spawned via the `Task` tool from within commands.

**File format:**
```markdown
---
description: "Agent purpose. Shown in /agents."
---

You are a [role] agent. [System prompt instructions.]
```

**How agents are invoked:** From within a command, Claude uses the Agent tool:
```
Use Agent tool to spawn the architect agent to analyze the codebase structure.
```

Claude Code automatically matches the task description to the right agent based on the agent's `description` field.

### Skills (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)

Skills are **auto-invoked** — Claude reads them automatically when the task context matches. You don't call them manually.

**File format:**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: "Triggers when Claude detects [specific task type]. This description is the trigger condition."
---

# Skill Title

Best practices, rules, and patterns Claude should follow.
```

**Key rule:** The `description` field is critical — it determines WHEN Claude activates this skill. Write it like a trigger condition.

**Example:** The `alpha-architecture` skill has:
```
description: "ALWAYS auto-invoked on ANY code writing task. Enforces Alpha AI's tech stack..."
```
This means Claude reads this skill every time it writes code, ensuring compliance.

### Hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`)

Hooks are event-driven — they fire automatically at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle.

**Available events:**
- `PreToolUse` — fires BEFORE Claude uses a tool (can block with exit code 2)
- `PostToolUse` — fires AFTER a tool is used
- `SessionStart` — fires when Claude Code starts
- `SessionEnd` — fires when session ends
- `Stop` — fires when Claude tries to finish (critical for auto-build loop)
- `UserPromptSubmit` — fires when user sends a message (currently unused — removed due to timeout errors on every message)
- `PreCompact` — fires before context compaction
- `TeammateIdle` — fires when an Agent Teams teammate has no tasks (exit code 2 = keep working)
- `TaskCompleted` — fires when an Agent Teams teammate completes a task (exit code 2 = quality gate reject)

**Hook types:**
- `"type": "command"` — runs a bash script, reads stdin for event data
- `"type": "prompt"` — sends a prompt to Claude for AI-based evaluation

**Blocking behavior:**
- Exit code 0 = allow (continue normally)
- Exit code 2 = BLOCK (prevent the action, show stderr to Claude)

**The auto-build Stop hook** (`scripts/auto-build-stop-hook.sh`) uses exit code 2 to prevent Claude from stopping until the product is complete. This is the core of the autonomous loop.

### Scripts (`scripts/*.sh`)

Bash scripts executed by hooks or run standalone. They receive event data via stdin as JSON.

**`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`** — Special variable that resolves to the plugin's root directory. Always use this in hooks.json paths.

### Agent Teams (Experimental)

When `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, the plugin supports **Agent Teams** — multiple Claude Code instances coordinated as teammates with shared task lists and direct messaging.

**Agent Teams integration points:**
- **`agents/parallel-builder.md`** — Upgrades from Agent subagents to real teammates (backend, frontend, mobile, QA as independent Claude sessions)
- **`commands/code-review.md`** — 5 reviewers as teammates who debate findings and challenge each other
- **`commands/debug.md`** — Competing hypothesis mode where 3-5 teammates investigate different root cause theories in parallel
- **`commands/auto-build.md`** — Phase execution with teammates for true multi-agent parallelism

**Agent Teams hooks (in `hooks/hooks.json`):**
- `TeammateIdle` — Checks shared task list for pending tasks and reassigns to idle teammates (exit code 2 = keep working)
- `TaskCompleted` — Quality gate that validates task output (architecture, tests, security) before accepting (exit code 2 = reject)

**Enable:** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `"env"`.

**Fallback:** When Agent Teams is not enabled, all commands fall back to the standard Agent tool subagent pattern automatically.

## Tech Stack — Core + Conditional (Modify With Care)

The stack is split into **CORE** (always enforced) and **CONDITIONAL** (only enforced if the project uses that technology). All consumers detect project context before applying rules.

**🎯 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**: `commands/references/AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` is the canonical tech-stack inventory. Modify the stack THERE. The 4 consumers below reference it — they should not duplicate stack content.

The 4 consumers (point to the canonical, do NOT inline stack details):

1. **`commands/auto-build.md`** — Tech Stack section is a short outline that references `AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` for each phase
2. **`skills/alpha-architecture/SKILL.md`** — Tech Stack section is an enforcement summary that defers to `AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` for the technology catalog (progressive disclosure)
3. **`commands/init-project.md`** — Stack Configuration covers only init-time scaffolding decisions; consults `AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` for library names and versions
4. **`commands/gen-prd.md`** — PRD generation instructions tell the agent to select sections from `AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` based on FEATURE_PROFILE, never to re-template stack content

**When you need to add/change a technology**: edit `AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` only. The 4 consumers will pick it up automatically because they reference (not duplicate) it.

Language-specific details are in reference files (keep in sync with core files):
- **`references/LANG_PROFILE_{LANG}.md`** — Directory structure, dependencies, configs, Docker, verify commands
- **`references/CODE_PATTERNS_{LANG}.md`** — Layer patterns, auth, email, payments, GenAI code examples
- **`references/INFRA_HOSTINGER_K3S.md`** — Hostinger VPS + K3s architecture, templates, CI/CD workflow, constraints

### Auth Rules (HARD — same for ALL languages):
- JWT in HTTP-Only Cookies ONLY
- NEVER localStorage or sessionStorage
- Access token: 30 min, Refresh token: 7 days
- CSRF: Double-submit cookie pattern
- Logout: Blacklist tokens in Redis
- Google OAuth2: Server-side Authorization Code Grant (authlib | passport-google | Spring OAuth2)
- All login methods end with JWT cookies (same flow)

### Layer Segregation Rules (same concept, ALL languages):
```
controllers → services → repositories → models + database
  ❌ controllers NEVER import from repositories
  ❌ services NEVER import from controllers
  ❌ repositories NEVER import from services
  ❌ NO business logic in controllers (thin handlers only)
  ❌ NO DB queries in services (use repos)

Python paths:  app/api/ → app/services/ → app/repositories/ → app/models/
NestJS paths:  src/*/controllers/ → src/*/services/ → Prisma → src/*/entities/
Spring paths:  **/controller/ → **/service/ → **/repository/ → **/entity/
```

## How to Make Common Modifications

### Add a New Slash Command

1. Create `commands/my-command.md`
2. Add frontmatter with `description` and `allowed-tools`
3. Write the instruction body
4. Reinstall plugin or restart with `--plugin-dir`

### Add a New Subagent

1. Create `agents/my-agent.md`
2. Add frontmatter with `description` and `allowed-tools`
3. Write the system prompt
4. Reference it from commands using Agent tool

### Add a New Skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter with `name` and `description` (trigger condition)
3. Write the rules/patterns
4. Claude will auto-invoke it when the task matches the description

### Add a New Hook

1. Edit `hooks/hooks.json`
2. Add entry under the appropriate event (PreToolUse, Stop, etc.)
3. If `type: "command"`, create the script in `scripts/`
4. If `type: "prompt"`, write the evaluation prompt inline
5. Restart Claude Code (hooks load at session start)

### Change the Autonomous Loop Behavior

- **Max iterations:** Edit `scripts/auto-loop.sh` → `MAX_ITERATIONS` variable
- **Rate limit:** Edit `scripts/auto-loop.sh` → `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` variable
- **Circuit breaker:** Edit `scripts/auto-loop.sh` → `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS`
- **Completion keyword:** Edit `scripts/auto-loop.sh` + `scripts/auto-build-stop-hook.sh` → `COMPLETION_PROMISE`
- **When to block exit:** Edit `scripts/auto-build-stop-hook.sh` logic

### Change the Project Structure Template

Edit the ENFORCED PROJECT STRUCTURE section in `commands/auto-build.md`. This is the ASCII tree that defines the folder layout for every auto-built project.

### Change Database Selection Rules

Edit the DATABASE USAGE PATTERNS section in `commands/auto-build.md` and the Database Selection Guide in `skills/alpha-architecture/SKILL.md`.

### Add Support for a New Backend Language

1. Create `references/LANG_PROFILE_{LANG}.md` — directory structure, deps, configs, Docker, verify commands
2. Create `references/CODE_PATTERNS_{LANG}.md` — layer patterns, auth, email, payments, GenAI code examples
3. Edit `skills/alpha-architecture/SKILL.md` — add language to Step 0a detection + Backend Stack table
4. Edit `commands/auto-build.md` — add language to Step 0.1 detection + Backend Stack table
5. Edit `commands/init-project.md` — add `--lang` option + per-language scaffolding
6. Edit `commands/gen-prd.md` — add language to tech stack section
7. Edit `CLAUDE.md` — add language to Backend Stack table

## Important Notes

1. **plugin.json goes ONLY inside `.claude-plugin/`** — commands, agents, skills, hooks go at plugin ROOT level, NOT inside .claude-plugin/
2. **Hooks reload on restart** — after editing hooks.json, you must restart Claude Code
3. **Skills are auto-invoked** — you don't call them, Claude picks them up based on task context
4. **`$ARGUMENTS`** — captures user input after the command name
5. **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`** — resolves to plugin root in hooks.json paths
6. **Exit code 2 in hooks** — blocks the action (critical for auto-build loop)
7. **Single source of truth for tech stack** — `commands/references/AUTO_BUILD_STACK.md` is canonical. The 4 consumers (auto-build.md, alpha-architecture SKILL, init-project.md, gen-prd.md) reference it; do NOT duplicate stack content into them.
8. **Test with `--plugin-dir` flag** — fastest way to iterate during development
9. **41 slash commands** covering the COMPLETE SDLC (planning → building → testing → shipping → operations → maintenance)
10. **11 subagents** for parallel and specialized work (7 core + brand-designer + devops-engineer + performance-profiler + documentation-writer)
11. **9 auto-invoked skills** for enforcing standards (6 core + security + devops + performance)
12. **36 modern app features** consistently across all core files (23 app + 3 open standards + 10 advanced GenAI)
13. **Open standards adopted**: Agent Skills (Anthropic), MCP (Linux Foundation), A2A (Google/Linux Foundation)
14. **Skills follow progressive disclosure** — alpha-architecture uses references/ for code patterns per spec
15. **Existing app support**: /analyze-project → /gap-analysis → /retrofit or /migrate-stack workflow
16. **`/init-project --existing`** — upgrades existing projects without overwriting code
17. **Full SDLC coverage** organized by phase: Planning (4) → Setup (4) → Building (7) → Quality (8) → Shipping (5) → DevOps (9) → Docs (3) → Maintenance (1)
18. **Security auto-enforced** — security skill triggers on any auth/input/secrets code
19. **Performance auto-enforced** — performance skill triggers on DB queries, caching, async code
20. **DevOps auto-enforced** — devops skill triggers on Docker, CI/CD, K8s, infra code
21. **Agent Teams support (experimental)** — when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, parallel-builder, code-review, debug, and auto-build upgrade to real multi-agent coordination with shared task lists, inter-agent messaging, TeammateIdle reassignment, and TaskCompleted quality gate hooks
